# challenge-bootstrap-portfolio
A landing page for own porfolio styled with bootstrap

## Description

This project represents a webpage about myself and my work portfolio using Bootstrap version 5.3.x. It was created to showcase my projects completed throughout the edX Web Development bootcamp and future work sample. 

## The webpage includes the following:
1. A navigation bar with navigation menu at the top and navigation links to the appropriate sections.
3. A hero section with a jumbotron featuring a picture, my name, and any additional info.
3. A work section, displaying my work in grid using Bootstrap cards and linking to the deployed projects.
4. A skills section.
5. An about/contact section.
6. A footer section
7. Additional formatting:
    - All hyperlinks have a hover effect.
    - All buttons display a box shadow upon hover.

## Usage

The webpage can be accessed using this URL: [to follow]

To use the webpage, you can click on the different sections in the navigation bar and get to the desired content section. Additionally, you can tap on the buttons thoughout the page to either get my contact details, or see the projects I've been working on.

The screenshot below displays the web page outlook for a large device. The page is designed to be responsive, so that the work projects and skills stack upon each other on smaller screen sizes.
